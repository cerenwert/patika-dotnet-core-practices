# Zoo Management System (OOP)

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as
inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism using a zoo management scenario.

## Features
- Abstract Animal class with common properties
- Different animal types with custom feeding and dosage logic
- Polymorphism via overridden methods

## Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Purpose
Educational project for demonstrating OOP principles.

## Implementation (C#)

This system is implemented in C# in accordance with the class diagram shown above.
Each animal type demonstrates polymorphism by applying its own feeding and medication
dosage behaviors. For simplicity, the sample code is provided within the Program.cs file.
